# Exploring-Factors-and-Policies-for-Poverty-by-Agent-Based-Simulation


Downlad and install the mason tool from here: http://cs.gmu.edu/~eclab/projects/mason/
Add the classes in a folder with the name poverty_v3 and add that folder into the Mason Source Packages.
Run Poverty_with_UI

#MASON:

MASON is a fast discrete-event multiagent simulation library core in Java, designed to be the foundation for large custom-purpose Java simulations, and also to provide more than enough functionality for many lightweight simulation needs. MASON contains both a model library and an optional suite of visualization tools in 2D and 3D.
