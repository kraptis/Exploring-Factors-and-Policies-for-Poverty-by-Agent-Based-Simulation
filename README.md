# Exploring-Factors-and-Policies-for-Poverty-by-Agent-Based-Simulation

This project presents a case study on agent-based simulation concerning the growth of poverty. The aim is to support policy makers and researchers to explore different factors concerning specific localities and policies that affect poverty's nature and growth. It presents a rather inclusive model, incorporating characteristics about the local environment, the local economic structure, community institutions and demographic characteristics, together with characteristics of individuals populating the locality. Experimental results show the potential of the constructed model.

Instruction

Downlad and install the mason tool from here: http://cs.gmu.edu/~eclab/projects/mason/
Add the classes in a folder with the name poverty_v3 and add that folder into the Mason Source Packages.
Run Poverty_with_UI. It is tested with Netbeans and Java 6.

#MASON:

MASON is a fast discrete-event multiagent simulation library core in Java, designed to be the foundation for large custom-purpose Java simulations, and also to provide more than enough functionality for many lightweight simulation needs. MASON contains both a model library and an optional suite of visualization tools in 2D and 3D.
